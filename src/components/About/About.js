            So, who is Charlie? Great question.
            I grew up in the beautiful state of Vermont in its most populated city, Burlington. As it turns out, I liked it enough to stay for college as well, attending the University of Vermont. I studied English and Political Science. Yes, I know, and here I am interested in web development. So it goes.
            I always wanted to move to New York City, but like so many before me, it was difficult. I would sit throughout my teens and wait for the day until I would be able to move here. The day finally came when I graduated college. After traveling through Europe the summer following graduation, much to my parents chagrin, I picked up my one suitcase (yes, one), and moved myself to NYC without knowing anyone. I worked in tech sales at a company called Trustpilot doing business development for about 11 months. I then found my way into a position at Yelp doing sales work as well. And yes, I made 100+ dials every day. After a while I knew it was not what I was supposed to do. I wanted something new, something fresh, something challenging. 
            I had done some self-teaching to try and learn how to code twice before, but I kept hitting walls which made it difficult to continue. When I left Yelp, I knew that I had to change something, and that is when General Assembly came into the mix. I realized that I wanted to devote my time and energy to making my dream of becoming a developer a reality. And here I sit, not broken hearted, but excited and ready to work for my future.
